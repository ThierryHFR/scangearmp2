				---Sane backend 'canon_pixma' for CANON's scanners---


# DESCRIPTION

	Because of changes in CANON's network communication protocols, some of CANON's scanner 
	became unsuported by sane.

	This backend is for making the CANON's scanners, using the new communication protocol,
	to be supported by sane and any of the frontends implementing sane. It reuse the code 
	of the scangearmp2 program to access to the scanners functionalities and implementing 
	the sane functions.

	It was done as a patch to have a minimum impact on the orginal scangearmp2 source code,
	but currently we choose to abandon this idea because it was difficult to make the 
	releases and had not that much interest for the developement.
	
	For ubuntu-based distributions: https://launchpad.net/~thierry-f/+archive/ubuntu/fork-michael-gruz
	For debian-based distribution : https://github.com/Ordissimo/scangearmp2/releases/tag/4.12 
	
	The scangearmp2 version of my repository, contains 3 elements:
	1 - binary libraries where the source code is not provided (under Canon license), it lets us use and 
	redistribute it, without the right to decompile it.
	2 - the scangearmp2 GUI in GPL provided by Canon, I have extended these features and migrated it
	to GTK3.
	3 - The code developed by the Compagny Ordissimo which is under GPL license, which is based on
	Canon's proprietary libraries. This code provides a backend to "sane".
	
	- libcanon-proprio-bin (https://github.com/Ordissimo/libcanon-proprio-bin) contains the proprietary
	libraries for Canon, I repackage them but do not make any modification on them. This allows you
	to use them without having to install the whole GTK2 toolkit, this supposes that you install
	libmfp2-canon.
	- libmfp2-canon (https://github.com/Ordissimo/libmfp2-canon) is the part provided by Ordissimo, which
	is under GPL license and is a backend of the sane project
	
	Finally, and to clear up any ambiguity, I am the developer of the company Ordissimo with no ties 
	whatsoever to Canon.

# ADVANTAGES

Better image quality than 'pixma' backend (with an output image size of 2480x3507 pixels) Usable in Wi-fi.

# STATE

Tested with sane 1.0.25, 1.0.27, 1.0.29 and 1.1.1<br>
In Platen, the backend recognizes CARD, L_L, L_P, 4X6_L, 4X6_P, HAGAKI_L, HAGAKI_P, 2L_L, 2L_P, A5, B5, A4 and LETTER formats.<br>
In ADF, the backend recognizes A4 and LETTER formats.<br>
The scan works in color or in gray map.<br>
The resolution option allow to have a 75, 150, 300 or 600 quality for the output.<br>
The source option allow to chose between Platen, ADF and ADF Duplex, i don't have a means of detection, so it depends on the hardware.<br>

# KNOWN PROBLEMS

When using xsane :
bug with the display of the selected color option (Fixed)
