				---Sane backend 'canon_pixma' for CANON's scanners---


# DESCRIPTION

	Because of changes in CANON's network communication protocols,some of CANON's scanner 
	became unsuported by sane.

	This backend is for making the CANON's scanners, using the new communication protocol,
	to be supported by sane and any of the frontends implementing sane. It reuse the code 
	of the scangearmp2 program to access to the scanners functionalities and implementing 
	the sane functions.

	It was done as a patch to have a minimun impact on the orginal scangearmp2 source code,
	but currently we choose to abandon this idea because it was difficult to make the 
	releases and had not that much interrest for the developement.
	
	For ubuntu-based distributions: https://launchpad.net/~thierry-f/+archive/ubuntu/fork-michael-gruz

# ADVANTAGES

Better image quality than 'pixma' backend (with an output image size of 2480x3507 pixels) Usable in Wi-fi.

# STATE

Tested with sane 1.0.25 and 1.0.27 (may not work for lower versions)
Currently the backend allow image in A4 format.
The scan works in color or in gray map.
The options are not well handled, so they might not work.
The color option allow to chose between color or graymap modes.
The resolution option allow to have a hight or low quality for the output.

# KNOWN PROBLEMS

When using xsane :
bug with the display of the selected color option (Fixed)

# Activate the backend
## For all distributions you need to activate the backend :
```
echo "canon_pixma"  >> /etc/sane.d/dll.conf # for activate the backend in sane
```

###### Firewall :
In case of problem with `firewalld` 
 you can copy the service definition 'scangearmp2/etc/canon-scan.xml'
 into '/etc/firewalld/services/' and activate the service (for the adequate zone(s))

```
sudo cp scangearmp2/etc/canon-scan.xml /etc/firewalld/services/
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=home --add-service=canon-scan
```

Nota: 
- A way to list detected scanners is `scanimage -L`
- To see firewall's rejected packages `firewall-cmd --set-log-denied=all` and then call `journalctl -f`
- See https://firewalld.org/documentation/service/options.html
